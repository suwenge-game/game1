# Data Storage Information

## How Content Storage Works

Your content management system uses **browser local storage** to save content. This means:

### ‚úÖ What Works:
- Content is saved in your browser
- Data persists between sessions
- No server required
- Works offline
- Fast and responsive

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Limitations:
- **Data is stored locally** - only on the device you're using
- **Not shared between devices** - content on your computer won't appear on your phone
- **Can be lost** if you clear browser data
- **Not backed up** automatically

## Why Content Might Not Save

### Common Reasons:
1. **Browser Storage Full** - Check if you have enough space
2. **Private/Incognito Mode** - Data doesn't persist in private browsing
3. **Browser Data Cleared** - Accidentally cleared cookies/storage
4. **Different Browser/Device** - Data is device-specific
5. **JavaScript Disabled** - Required for the system to work

## Solutions

### 1. Regular Backups
- Use the **Export Data** button in admin panel
- Download your content as JSON file
- Store backups in cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)

### 2. Check Browser Settings
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled
- Check if local storage is allowed
- Don't use private/incognito mode for content management

### 3. Data Recovery
- Use **Import Data** to restore from backup
- Check browser's developer tools for stored data

## How to Backup Your Data

1. Go to admin panel: `https://deskgame.xyz/admin`
2. Scroll down to "Data Management" section
3. Click "üì§ Export Data"
4. Save the JSON file to your computer
5. Store it in a safe place (cloud storage recommended)

## How to Restore Data

1. Go to admin panel: `https://deskgame.xyz/admin`
2. Scroll down to "Data Management" section
3. Click "üì• Import Data"
4. Select your backup JSON file
5. Confirm the import

## Best Practices

1. **Backup regularly** - At least once a week
2. **Test backups** - Make sure you can restore them
3. **Use same browser** - For consistency
4. **Don't clear browser data** - Unless you have backups
5. **Keep multiple backups** - In different locations

## Alternative Solutions

If you need server-side storage, consider:
- Database integration (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- Cloud storage (Firebase, Supabase)
- File-based storage on server
- Content Management Systems (WordPress, etc.)

## Technical Details

- **Storage Location**: Browser's localStorage
- **Storage Key**: `deskgame_content`
- **Data Format**: JSON array
- **Max Size**: ~5-10MB (browser dependent)
- **Persistence**: Until manually cleared

## Troubleshooting

### Content Not Saving:
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Verify JavaScript is enabled
3. Try different browser
4. Clear browser cache and try again

### Content Disappeared:
1. Check if you're on the same device/browser
2. Look for backup files
3. Check browser's localStorage in developer tools
4. Try importing from backup

### Need Help?
- Check browser's developer console (F12)
- Verify localStorage contains `deskgame_content`
- Test with a simple piece of content first
